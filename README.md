# Reddit Vid Downloader

I created this from a desire to download Reddit hosted videos after realizing there isn't an option to download on the website. Reddit also doesn't make it easy to download videos with sound as the video and audio files are split up in the ```json```. This program merges the video file and audio file of a Reddit video, and downloads Reddit hosted videos to the program directory. 

WORKS FOR: Mac, Linux, Windows

## How to use
Coming soon
